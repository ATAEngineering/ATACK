# ATACK
The ATA Chemical Kinetics (ATACK) is a Python framework developed by [ATA Engineering](http://www.ata-e.com) for automatic, generalized reduction of chemical kinetic mechanisms. ATACK uses directed relational graph based algorithms coupled with an extensible suite of test cases and error metrics to enable on-demand creation of tuned reduced kinetic mechanisms for specific applications.

# Dependencies
ATACK is built on and designed to work with other open source Python packages:
 * Numpy
 * Scipy
 * Cantera
 * scikit-learn
 * StanShock

# Obtaining the Module
The source code for ATACK is freely available to the US Government under SBIR data rights. For more information and to request a copy please contact [Zach LaBry](zach.labry@ata-e.com).
